A polynomial in $x$ is a sum of multiples of powers of $x$. If the highest power of $x$ is $n$, then the polynomial is described as having degree $n$ in $x$.

**Definition 1.1.** A polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ is defined as:

$$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$

where:
- $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_0$ are constants called **coefficients**.
- $a_n$, where $a_n \\neq 0$, is the **leading coefficient**.
- $n$ is a non-negative integer called the **degree** of the polynomial, denoted as $\\deg(P)$.

## 2. Roots Of A Polynomial

Roots of a polynomial are such that when $\\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $P(x)$, then $P(\\alpha) = 0$. When a polynomial has an equal pair of roots, say $(x-2)^2(x-1)$, the roots are $2, 2$ and $1$. Subsequently we can say that each polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots.

**Definition 2.1.** The $k$-th symmetric sum, $S_k$, is given by:

$$S_k(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\sum_{1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\cdots < i_k \\leq n} x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \\cdots x_{i_k}$$

If we have a cubic polynomial with roots $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, the symmetric sums are simply:

$$S_1 = \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma$$

$$S_2 = \\alpha\\beta + \\beta\\gamma + \\gamma\\alpha$$

$$S_3 = \\alpha\\beta\\gamma$$

For a cubic polynomial $P(x)$ where the leading coefficient is 1, these sums determine the coefficients:

$$P(x) = x^3 - (\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma)x^2 + (\\alpha\\beta + \\beta\\gamma + \\gamma\\alpha)x - (\\alpha\\beta\\gamma)$$

Or:

$$P(x) = x^3 - S_1 x^2 + S_2 x - S_3$$

Are you able to do the same for a quadratic polynomial? Notice anything familiar?

## 2.1 Vieta's Theorem

**Definition 2.2.** A direct consequence to this is Vieta's Theorem. Let a polynomial $P(x)$:

$$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$$

$$P(x) = a_n \\left( x^n + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_2}{a_n} x^2 + \\frac{a_1}{a_n} x + \\frac{a_0}{a_n} \\right)$$

Similar to the above cubic case, we can then say that:

$$P(x) = a_n \\left( x^n - S_1 x^{n-1} + S_2 x^{n-2} - S_3 x^{n-3} + \\cdots + (-1)^n S_n \\right)$$

We factor out $a_n$ so that the leading coefficient inside the bracket is 1, and so we can write it in terms of $S$. Then,

**Coefficient of** $x^{n-1}$: $\\dfrac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} = -S_1 \\implies S_1 = -\\dfrac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}$

**Coefficient of** $x^{n-2}$: $\\dfrac{a_{n-2}}{a_n} = S_2 \\implies S_2 = \\dfrac{a_{n-2}}{a_n}$

**Coefficient of** $x^{n-3}$: $\\dfrac{a_{n-3}}{a_n} = -S_3 \\implies S_3 = -\\dfrac{a_{n-3}}{a_n}$

So, we can generalise that:

$$S_k = (-1)^k \\frac{a_{n-k}}{a_n}$$

and we are done.

## 2.2 Tutorial

**[AMC 10A 2006]** What is the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation:

$$\\frac{2003}{2004}x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0$$

We can turn it into a quadratic:

$$\\frac{2003}{2004}x^2 + x + 1 = 0$$

Suppose $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are roots to the equation, so:

$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\beta} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{S_1}{S_2}$$

Remember that for a $n$-degree polynomial:

$$S_1 = -\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}, \\quad S_2 = \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n}$$

For a quadratic:

$$S_1 = -\\frac{a_1}{a_2}, \\quad S_2 = \\frac{a_0}{a_2}$$

So,

$$\\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{-\\frac{2004}{2003}}{\\frac{2004}{2003}} = -1$$
